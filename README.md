Bugs: In the guess a card game if a '10' card is chosen of any suit, it wont get the right answer for the delta.
In the nim game if the user enters in a non-integer then the game will go into an infinite loop.

This program is meant for the user to enjoy a variety of 3 games which include Guess a card, Nim, and Mystery House. 

Mystery House is a text based game that features ten rooms and three different zombies. Each gameplay will be different 
from the last because the rooms are randomly selected. Each zombie has unique characteristics about them and different 
chances of eating the players brains. You can tell which zombie is going to be in the next roombecause each one makes 
different noises. Once the player reaches the exit room the game is over and the user wins.
